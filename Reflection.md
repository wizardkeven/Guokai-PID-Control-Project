## 1. Effect of the PID component

PID controller is composed of three components: ï¼° -> Proportional component, I -> Integral component and D -> differential component. It uses a linear combination to output the steering angle given CTE-> Cross Track Error. Actually I didn't have a clear understanding on these components during course video and practices. These were no more than some given conceptions and I had no what role they are playing in a driving car.
